### Abstract

The domestication syndrome of many plants includes changes in their mating systems. The evolution of the latter is shaped by a dynamic interplay between ecological and genetic factors that are particular to an area; therefore, observing agroecosystems alone will only show a partial picture of the diversity contained in wild-to-domesticated species complexes. Thus, the reproductive biology of wild relatives must be studied in their natural distribution to understand the mating system of a crop species as a whole.
*Gossypium hirsutum* (upland cotton) includes both domesticated varieties and wild populations of the same species, and whilst it is commonly recognized that cultivated cotton is self-pollinated, little is known about its wild relatives. In this study we selected two wild metapopulations for comparison with domesticated plants and one metapopulation with evidence of recent gene flow between wild and crop relatives, to evaluate the mating system of cotton’s wild-to-domesticated complex. Through classic reproductive biology methods, our data demonstrate that upland cotton presents a mixed mating system, throughout the whole complex. Given cotton’s capacity of outcrossing, differences caused by the domestication process in cultivated individuals can have consequences in its wild relatives. Hence, it is essential to characterize the diversity of the wild relatives in their natural distribution, as well as their interactions, in order to implement adequate strategies for conservation and biosecurity.
